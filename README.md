# Social Links

Social links is designed to be an open-source version of the [LinkTree](https://linktr.ee/) web application. The goal of the application is to give content creators and business owners the ability to consolidate all their links behind a single customizable website. The main page of the website is used to contain links to Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Other websites, or whatever the user wants all behind a single easy to remember domain that is unique for each user. Currently LinkTree only offers users to have a linktr.ee/<username> URL for around $8 - $10 USD. A user can purchase a custom domain name and hosting service from websites like [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) for the same monthly price as LinkTree. Social Links is a designed to be easy to deploy, use, and customize regardless of a userâ€™s technical ability. It contains an admin interface that gives the user the ability to change the text, links, background image, and color scheme on the main page.

## Inspiration
My wife is a Hair and Makeup Artist, and her industry relies heavily on the use of social media for marketing and to display her portfolio of work. Because of this she has an Instagram, Facebook, Website, and other links to products she sells. My goal was to create a custom made LinkTree under her own custom domain [maria.maneobsessions.me](https://maria.maneobsessions.me/) and give her the ability to update those links, profile pictures, background images, and color schemes without directly editing the HTML file. Creating a basic HTML page was easy but I wanted to add more functionality to the page and give her the ability update the page herself without relying on me. My end goal is to create an easy-to-use web application that gives other stylist the ability to create a single easy to use webpage. I have plans for more customization and other functionality that I want to bring in the future.

Note: The Installation and Getting Started steps assume the user has already secured a website domain and hosting provider.

## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:cms-WebDesign/SocialLinks.git
docker-compose run app django-admin startproject app .
```
Note: If on Linux you will need to adjust the file permissions as they are owned by root. To do so execute the following command
```
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .
```

## Getting Started
```
docker-compose up
```
Open another terminal and run the following commands to create the database superuser.
```
docker-compose run app python manage.py migrate
docker-compose run app bash
python manage.py createsuperuser --username admin --email admin
```
To run other django commands simply type:
```
docker-compose run app [cmd]
```
or
```
docker-compose exec app [cmd]
```

Once the container is up and the admin account is created head on over to the /admin/ tab and login.

Once logged in the user can customize the links, background, colors, or text on the page to their choosing. Simply save the changes and the website will be updated with the new changes.
